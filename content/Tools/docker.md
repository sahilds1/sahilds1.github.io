The error message you're seeing combined with Docker likely means your app is running inside a Docker container, and the container environment doesn't have the correct dependencies installed.

When you're working with Docker and see this type of error, one way to reset your Docker container and rebuild everything is by using:

docker-compose down

However, it does NOT delete volumes or built images unless you explicitly tell it to.

docker-compose down --volumes --rmi all

Rebuild the Docker image with dependencies from scratch:


docker-compose build --no-cache

Restart the app

docker-compose up



The lucide-react package might have been installed locally, but Docker containers are isolated environments. If the node_modules folder wasn't copied into the container during the Docker build process, the package won't exist inside the container.

Rebuilding with --no-cache forces Docker to reinstall everything fresh.
