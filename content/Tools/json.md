You can convert Python data types to a JSON-formatted string with json.dumps() or write them to files using json.dump(). 

Similarly, you can read JSON data from files with json.load() and parse JSON strings with json.loads()


JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a widely-used text-based format for data interchange. Its syntax resembles Python dictionaries but with some differences, such as using only double quotes for strings and lowercase for Boolean values.
