To measure the semantic similarity of text strings and address the computational efficiency of using BERT, Reimers and Gurevych developed a model that uses pretrained BERT models in a siamese network structure to create sentence embeddings. They evaluated SBERT on common semantic textual similarity tasks and assessed its computational efficiency.
