# Analyzing Local Election Results using Streamlit

To analyze local election results, I built a data app using the Lehigh County Department of Voter Registration Election Results and Streamlit

- Lehigh County Department of Voter Registration 
- Streamlit 


<!-- # Lehigh County Department of Voter Registration 


# Python Data App: `Streamlit`

The best framework depends on your specific needs:

- **Quick prototypes and simple visualizations:** Streamlit
- **Interactive dashboards and complex visualizations:** Dash
- **Highly customized and flexible layouts:** Panel
- **Machine learning demos and model deployment:** Gradio

Remember to consider factors like the complexity of your app, the level of customization required, your familiarity with web development concepts, and the size of the community supporting each framework. -->
