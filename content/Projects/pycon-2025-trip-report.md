I went to my first PyCon US in Pittsburgh\! Thank you to the Python Software Foundation for awarding me a [Travel Grant](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2025/03/travelgrants2025.html) which supported the cost of the ticket and hotel. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tSRzwArLtFoY8o6DQNsVP5ZQrFQcU0mFMDkYPjORMQs/edit?usp=sharing) is a Google Doc with the highlights of my experience at the conference.
