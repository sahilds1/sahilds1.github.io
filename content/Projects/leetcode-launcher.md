Title: Building a LeetCode Problem Launcher using Python
Date: 2025-02-05
Summary: Tiny Python script: [https://github.com/sahilds1/tiny-tools](https://github.com/sahilds1/tiny-tools)
Status: draft

We can construct the URL using just the problem number using the LeetCode GraphQL API  endpoint, 
which I found using the Chrome Developer Tools 


<!-- While studying data structures, I keep a log of LeetCode problems and use that to redo problems

I search for problems on LeetCode often enough that I wanted a shortcut for opening them up.

I have the problem numbers but the LeetCode problem URLs are composed of keywords related to the problems:

- 1480 Running Sum of 1d Array: https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/description/
- 1672 Richest Customer Wealth https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/description/
- 412 Fizz Buzz https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/description/
- 876 Middle of the Linked List https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/description

Using Chrome's Developer Tools when I search for problems on LeetCode's [Problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/) page 
I found that  LeetCode has a GraphQL API problemsetQuestionList data  [that I can query with the problem number to get 
the information I need to open up the problem.]


With the LeetCode GraphQL API []  and  the Python requests library, I was able to write a Python script
to open a LeetCode problem from it problem number  -->
