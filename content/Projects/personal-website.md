Summary: Site hosted on GitHub Pages: [https://github.com/sahilds1/sahilds1.github.io](https://github.com/sahilds1/sahilds1.github.io)
Status: draft

To start blogging about software projects, I built this site using Pelican, Sidecar, and GitHub

- [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican): A static site generator tool that builds these web pages from content in text files and templatized HTML
- [Sidecar](https://github.com/seanh/sidecar): A Pelican "theme" of CSS stylesheets and HTML templates used by Pelican during the building of this site
- [GitHub](https://github.com/): A platform to host this site on GitHub Pages and build the web pages using Pelican and GitHub Actions

## Static Site Generator: `Pelican` 

Pelican's a Python based static site generator that has built-in blogging features and a variety  of community-created themes. 


Building a Personal Website using a Static Site Generator


With the advent of single-page applications, an updated approach to server-side scripting was introduced, known as server-side rendering. With server-side rendering, static HTML can be sent from the server to the client, and client-side JavaScript then makes the web page dynamic by attaching event handlers to the HTML elements in a process called hydration. Examples of frameworks that support server-side rendering are Next.js, Nuxt.js, Angular, and React.

An alternative to server-side rendering is static site generation. With server-side rendering, the page is generally assembled on the server once per each request. By contrast, with static site generation, the application generates all the static HTML pages at build time. These pre-built pages are then sent to the client at each request, without having to build them again. This leads to faster rendering times, since a new page doesn't have to be generated on every request; the server simply hands over a file it already generated in the past. The downside is that when some data on the page changes, it needs to be rebuilt. Examples of static site generation tools are Jekyll and Gatsby. Sites generated by static site generation tools are often hosted on Netlify, Vercel or GitHub pages.

Alternatives in other languages are: 

- [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll): Ruby-based, notable for its integration with GitHub Pages
- [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo): Go-based, notable for its speed at building large sites
- [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/): JavaScript-based, notable for its flexible HTML templating system

I chose Pelican because I wanted to use my site to blog and already had a Python development environment. 

After installing Pelican, you can set up a skeleton project using Pelican's `pelican-quickstart` tool. 

## Pelican Theme: `Sidecar`

Pelican has built in "simple" HTML templates that can be modified and styled using  CSS.

A variety of community created themes are available on GitHub

I chose to use the community created `Sidecar` theme  because I don't have experience with CSS.

## Hosting: `GitHub`

To have GitHub run `pelican` for you and build your site, you can use a GitHub Actions workflow
