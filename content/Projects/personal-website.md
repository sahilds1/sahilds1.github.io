# Building a Personal Website using a Static Site Generator

To start blogging about software projects, I built this site using Pelican, Sidecar, and GitHub

- [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican): A static site generator tool that builds these web pages from content in text files and templatized HTML
- [Sidecar](https://github.com/seanh/sidecar): A Pelican "theme" of CSS stylesheets and HTML templates used by Pelican during the building of this site
- [GitHub](https://github.com/): A platform to host this site on GitHub Pages and build the web pages using Pelican and GitHub Actions

# Static Site Generator: `Pelican` 

<!-- I built this site using Pelican  which 

1. "Blog aware"
2. "Themes"
3. "Python based"

Alternatives:
- **Jekyll:** Ruby-based, known for its simplicity and blog-awareness.
- **Hugo:** Go-based, known for its speed and flexibility.
- **Eleventy**: JavaScript-based, known for its simplicity and extensibility.
