Title: About

Hey! 👋 I'm Sahil, a software developer living in the Philadelphia area. I previously completed a PhD in a computational biology lab at Northwestern University in Chicago.

I'm currently looking for a mid-level backend/AI-ML software engineering role at an established software company that builds AI or ML-powered product features to help users navigate complex information in their domain and that fosters a culture of trust and community contribution.

I'm an open source contributor on a team at Code for Philly building a website of AI-powered research tools for bipolar disorder to help patients achieve stability faster. I'm currently working on a chatbot that searches bipolar research papers to answer users' questions. I'm blogging about programming at [sahilds1.github.io](sahilds1.github.io) and you can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sahilds1).

I've been a machine learning engineer at technically rigorous, venture-funded software startups based in Boston, Seattle, and Chicago, building business analytics tools for operations and marketing teams. I focused on building ML evaluation systems that kept our ML models reliable in production. 

During my PhD at Northwestern, I developed bioinformatics software that identifies genes significantly associated with a disease using a novel resampling method on genomics data (10⁴-10⁵ genes by 10¹-10² samples) to design new experiments for collaborators researching cancer.

When I'm not coding, you can find me training for my next half marathon or attending a local film festival.
