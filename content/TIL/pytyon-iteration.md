**The given end point is never part of the generated sequence**; range(10) generates 10 values, the legal indices for items of a sequence of length 10. It is possible to let the range start at another number, or to specify a different increment (even negative; sometimes this is called the ‘step’):

```
list(range(5, 10))
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
